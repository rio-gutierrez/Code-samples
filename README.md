# Code-samples

Sample of some codes from previous coursework (most of these codes are linked to assigments that can be found in the [Coursework repo](https://gitlab.com/rio-gutierrez/coursework/-/tree/main)). Among the files you may find:

- C++ codes: Root-finding algorithms; Gaussian elimination; Krylov methods; etc
- Matlab codes: Finite elements (FEM); Poisson solver; hyperbolic, parabalic, and elliptic PDEs; etc
- Python codes: Creation of Bowen-York initial data for a black hole with both linear and angular momenta
